        I believe that education is an essential part of society and should continue well into adulthood. In this modern world, we are seeing more and more so-called "courses" made available for the employees of companies to enable them to reach their full potential - this is a great opportunity for adult improvement and benefits not only the employee but society as a whole. 

        Schools are another essential area of education, providing the means necessary for students to get the "building blocks" for future development. As such it is extremely important that schools teach not only the curriculum but also life skills such as internet safety, money and time management and politics. These life skills help people to make more informed decisions to protect themselves and others from a variety of attacks.

        Where do I come in? I produce and teach high-quality lessons on a variety of subjects and am beginning on the long journey to produce resources to aid social skills. My resources are free for anyone to view and use on my website via the Teaching Resources page. Enjoy!

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
