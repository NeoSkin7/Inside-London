# .tk is the top-level domain of Tokelau.

So how did it end up here, on a British website? And what is Tokelau?

Tokelau is an island chain dependant territory of New Zealand. It has it's own top-level domain (domain ending assigned to a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code.) I'm told that it's a lovely place, a tropical island paradise - but I wouldn't know, I've never been. Tokelau have made their domain free to use and have a couple of initiatives surrounding it, from Dot TK Apps to free domains for all - of course!

## Why Am I Using Their Top-Level Domain?

You can get your own .tk domain from [Freenom](https://freenom.com), as I did. I used the top-level domain at the time because it was cheap - in fact it was free! I no longer struggle to pay for this site's upkeep, however the top-level domain has stuck. I'm now rather fond of it, it adds a personality to a domain - and of course people asking: "Why .tk?" But, a word of warning before you get your own .tk domain, they come with their own challenges. For a start, you don't actually own the domain, only freedom to use it, this means that you are bound by their contract and they may choose to take the domain away at any time. Additionally, because it's free many services refuse to work with .tk domains - try registering a custom domain email with a provider, they won't accept it!

So that's the story, choose your own top-level domain - but know the consequences.
