# Year 10 and 11 Homework Expectations

## Self-Quizzing

Firstly, I do not believe that self-quizzing is an effective strategy for homework at the year 11 level. After doing this for four years, I can safely inform you that the novelty wears off quickly leading to boredom and a general distaste for the strategy. Whilst this has been fortified using additional subject-set homework and online services it still seems like a chore to most. So, students often resort to modifying the guiding principle to simply "look, write" instead of the full "look, cover, write, check". This means that self-quizzing loses its fundamental effect as a homework and revision tool due to a lack of mental stimulation and inadequate memorisation technique which leads to less information ingest.

As of yet there is nothing put in place to counter this except additional homework in the form of subject-set worksheets and online services. Does this not seem crazy to you? A solution would be to simply scrap the whole thing past year 9 or greatly reduce the workload, more on that later.

## Mathematics

Here is the mathematics: Raising attainment (RA) sessions (beginning soon) last for an hour after school – keep a tally of the time. Then, it will take an average of a half-hour to travel home for most students. Next, each subject has a half-hour of self-quizzing (which can take up to an hour for some students to complete) followed by an additional half-hour of subject-set homework in the form of a worksheet or online service. With each night having two subjects worth of homework, that is another two hours to add to our now three and a half hours of time after school.[^1] With school finishing at 1500 (3 PM) and three and a half hours to add, it is now 1830 (6.30 PM) which is when most students begin eating dinner and then go to bed.[^2]

## Science

So, all this said, where is the time for socialising? It is scientifically proven that students need positive mental stimulation such as spending time outside or talking with friends throughout the day in order to get a high-quality sleep.[^3]

Sleep is important as it is when the brain consolidates memory, aiding the person to better retrieve and use the knowledge.[^4] This is a vital process and so it is crucial that students are able to get a high-quality night's sleep to perform well in examinations.

## Homework Strategies

All of this leads to an urgent need for a more effective homework strategy that is able to reduce homework time and thus improve students time for other activities that would provide positive mental stimulation. So, what is to be done about this? There are a few possible so0lutions to this predicament, some of which are detailed below.

- ### Effective Revision

[^1]: There can be additional homework set which would last approximately half-an-hour.
[^2]: A maximum of five hours could be considered for this total - bringing the time to 2000 (8 PM).
