Firstly, I do not believe that self-quizzing is an effective strategy for homework at the year 11 level. After doing this for four years, I can safely inform you that the novelty wears off quickly leading to boredom and a general distaste for the strategy. Whilst this has been fortified using additional subject-set homework and online services it still seems like a chore to most. So, students often resort to modifying the guiding principle to simply "look, write" instead of the full "look, cover, write, check". This means that self-quizzing loses its fundamental effect as a homework and revision tool due to a lack of mental stimulation and inadequate memorisation technique which leads to less information ingest.
