# Hello!

My brand new website has just launched! You can view it [here](https://neoski.tk).

## Content

On my website I aim to bring you the latest and greatest news from across STEM subjects alongside information about my life and some teaching resources.

A frequent theme on this site will be London as I plan to guide you through the insides of the great city as I take time to explore it myself.

**Great things are coming soon - are you ready for the adventure?**
